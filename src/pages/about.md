Hi, I'm Michał Prządka and this is my personal blog. I write about various things that interest me but I hope you will sometimes find something useful here. I work at Kantar, a marketing consulting company. You can find my full work bio on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/przadka/).

I am based in Warsaw, where I live with my two daughters ([Anika](https://anika.toasterthoughts.eu) and Maira) and my wife Kavita Ramji. 

If you want to connect you can DM me via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/przadka) or LinkedIn.
